 [3] GETTING SET UP

    [3.1] STARTING PLAYER

          Decide on a starting player. If you're the winner from the previous
          game, you're the starting player, if it's the first game & you're
          reading this then it's you, you're the starting player.

    [3.2] PLAY SPACE SET UP

             [3.2.1] The starting player should gather 2 or 3 other players.
                     This game plays best with 4 players but works with 3
                     players in a pinch.

             [3.2.2] The starting player should gather all 20 game cards
                     together & pull out the 300 BAUD Hacker cards, then
                     choose 1 of the 4 300 BAUD Hacker cards & return it to
                     the box, that hacker is fixing the phones & is out of
                     play for the rest of the game. Canonically Cereal should
                     be fixing the phones but the starting player can choose
                     whichever of the 300 BAUD Hacker cards they please.

             [3.2.3] The starting player should then shuffle the remaining 19
                     cards & deal 3 cards to themselves, face down, then deal
                     1 card to the player on their right, face down, & deal 2
                     cards to the remaining players, face down.

             [3.2.4] The starting player should then place the remaining
                     cards in a stack, face down to create the DECK.

             [3.2.5] The starting player should then turn over the top card
                     on the DECK, place it beside the DECK face up to
                     populate the SNOOP space.


 [4] GAMEPLAY

    [4.1] OVERVIEW

          Starting with the starting player (obviously) players take turns in
          clockwise order until a player announces HACK THE PLANET. Each turn
          proceeds as below.

    [4.2] TAKING A TURN

             [4.2.1] Add a card from your hand to your FILES & resolve the
                     action described in the card's Info Box if the card's
                     criteria are met.

             [4.2.2] Add the card from the top of the deck or the card in
                     the SNOOP space to your hand. If you remove the card
                     from the SNOOP space, replenish the SNOOP space
                     immediately & if there are no cards left in the DECK
                     after replenishing the SNOOP space then HACK THE PLANET.

                     Some cards modify how you draw cards, draw appropriately
                     where the criteria in the card's Info Box are met, the
                     effect of these cards apply to drawing from the DECK
                     only & do not apply if you chose to move the card from
                     the SNOOP space to your hand.

             [4.2.3] Without revealing the cards to any other players, move 1
                     card from your hand to the hand of the player on your
                     left & move 1 card from your hand to the hand of the
                     player on your right.

             [4.2.4] From your hand, return cards to the bottom of the DECK
                     until you are left with only 1 card in your hand.


 [5] HACK THE PLANET

    [5.1] When there are no cards left in the DECK or when resolving a card
          that instructs you to HACK THE PLANET, the player who's turn it is
          should loudly announce "HACK THE PLANET", all other players should
          loudly respond "HACK THE PLANET" - there is no penalty for not
          doing this aside from having to live with being a lamer.

    [5.2] The player that announced HACK THE PLANET should complete their
          turn & play should proceed as normal.

    [5.3] When the player who announced HACK THE PLANET takes their next turn,
          the game is over & the score should be tallied. See WINNING & LOSING
          below for more info.


 [7] WINNING & LOSING

    [7.1] At the end of the game, each player adds up the DATA VALUE of the
          cards in their FILES & the player with the highest number wins. Easy.

    [7.2] In the event of a draw, I'm sorry, you have to play again.



 [8] VARIANTS

    [8.1] Open Source. Players hands are kept face up, below their FILES so
          each player can see what the other players have in their hand.

    [8.2] Encrypted. Players FILES are kept face down. When it's time to HACK
          THE PLANET, all players overturn their cards before the last round is
          played. The card in the SNOOP space should remain face up in this
          variant.
